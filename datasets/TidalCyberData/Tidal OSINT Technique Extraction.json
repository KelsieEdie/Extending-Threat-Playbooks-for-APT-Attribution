They called it \"BumbleBee\", since the developer of this tool originally named it as such. BumbleBee is a modular backdoor that comprises two applications, a server and a client application (a master and slaver application, respectively in the malware\u2019s jargon). Once the client application is deployed on the target computer (these are commonly local government devices), threat actors can control the machine using the server module",

This ransomware performs double extortion attacks and exhibits several similarities and technical overlaps with REvil ransomware. REvil ransomware disappeared just a couple of months before Ransom Cartel surfaced and just one month after 14 of its alleged members were arrested in Russia. When Ransom Cartel first appeared, it was unclear whether it was a rebrand of REvil or an unrelated threat actor who reused or mimicked REvil ransomware code.",

The lure document is a PowerPoint file that exploits a code execution technique, which is designed to be triggered when the user starts the presentation mode and moves the mouse. The code execution runs a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a dropper from OneDrive. The latter downloads a payload that extracts and injects in itself a new PE (Portable Executable) file, that the analysis showed to be a variant of a malware family known as Graphite, that uses the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive for C&C communications.",

    "Description": "A few months back, Intezer and BlackBerry researchers discovered a new, undetected Linux malware that acts in this parasitic nature. They have aptly named this malware Symbiote. What makes Symbiote different from other Linux malware that they usually come across, is that it needs to infect other running processes to inflict damage on infected machines. Instead of being a standalone executable file that is run to infect a machine, it is a shared object (SO) library that is loaded into all running processes using LD_PRELOAD (T1574.006), and parasitically infects the machine. Once it has infected all the running processes, it provides the threat actor with rootkit functionality, the ability to harvest credentials, and remote access capability.",

    "Description": "Credential stealing malware is commonly observed in the landscape of cyber attacks today. Zscaler ThreatLabz team has discovered many new types of stealer malwares across different attack campaigns. Stealers are malicious programs that threat actors use to collect sensitive information with various techniques including keylogging, cookie stealing, and sending stolen information to the Command and Control Server. \nRecently, ThreatLabz  identified a novel windows based malware creating a registry key as FFDroider. Based on this observation, ThreatLabz named this new malware the Win32.PWS.FFDroider. Designed to send stolen credentials and cookies to a Command & Control server, FFDroider disguises itself on victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s machines to look like the instant messaging application \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Telegram\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.",

IcedID is a banking trojan that first appeared in 2017, usually, it is delivered via malspam campaigns and has been widely used as an initial access vector in multiple ransomware intrusions.\n\nUpon execution of the IcedID DLL, discovery activity was performed which was followed by the dropping of a Cobalt Strike beacon on the infected host. Along the way, the threat actors installed remote management tools such as Atera and Splashtop for persisting in the environment. While remaining dormant most of the time, the adversary deployed Conti ransomware on the 19th day (shortly after Christmas), resulting in domain wide encryption.",

    "Description": "A threat report published by Symantec in October 2021 recently caught Fortinet's attention. It discusses an unknown threat actor conducting an espionage campaign in Southeast Asia using a new custom malware arsenal. What piqued Fortinet's curiosity most was the mention of a DLL payload loaded from the registry that had yet to be discovered.\n\nThe module is stored as a compressed blob with a custom header in the registry. It is never written to disk, rendering it unlikely to appear in datasets like VirusTotal.\n\nFortinet's have now uncovered a sample of the module and a plethora of components and variants dating as far back as 2017. They have observed the progression of the development of this malware throughout the years. Over time, custom code was added, components were upgraded, capabilities expanded, the code became neater, and modularity increased.\n\nThis blog examines the different components of this malware and their progression over time, thereby mapping the evolution of the Soul malware framework.",

Ultimately, they remain an adaptable and evolving threat that must be closely studied by defenders seeking to stay one step ahead.\n\nMandiant continues to track multiple clusters of suspected Russian intrusion activity that have targeted business and government entities around the globe. Based on our assessment of these activities, they have identified two distinct clusters of activity, UNC3004 and UNC2652.

This vulnerability was addressed by the update released by Zoho on September 16, 2021 for ServiceDesk Plus versions 11306 and above. The FBI and CISA assess that advanced persistent threat (APT) cyber actors are among those exploiting the vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to upload executable files and place webshells, which enable the adversary to conduct post-exploitation activities, such as compromising administrator credentials, conducting lateral movement, and exfiltrating registry hives and Active Directory files.",

This malware family has the capability to steal the cookies, credentials, credit card (CC) information, crypto wallets, and other sensitive details stored on the victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s device. To accomplish this task, the malware uses various techniques to extract information from the victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s machine.  \n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039Cyble Research Labs has harvested the latest variant of Raccoon Stealer to study the stealer malware family behavior and the techniques that it uses for infection. The TA behind the Raccoon Stealer has posted the malware\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capabilities on a cybercrime forum, wherein he has mentioned that the malware can run on both 32- and 64-bit systems without .NET dependencies, and the logs are collected in RAM instead of the disk, among others.",

    "Description": "In Q2 2021, the PT Expert Security Center incident response team conducted an investigation in an energy company. The investigation revealed that the company's network had been compromised by an unknown group for the purpose of data theft. They gave the group the name ChamelGang (from the word \"chameleon\"), because the group disguised its malware and network infrastructure under legitimate services of Microsoft, TrendMicro, McAfee, IBM, and Google. The attackers employed two methods. They acquired domains that imitate legitimate ones (newtrendmicro.com, centralgoogle.com, microsoft-support.net, cdn-chrome.com, mcafee-upgrade.com). In addition, the APT group placed SSL certificates that also imitated legitimate ones (github.com, www.ibm.com, jquery.com, update.microsoft-support.net) on its servers. To achieve their goal, the attackers used a trending penetration method\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsupply chain. The group compromised a subsidiary and penetrated the target company's network through it.",

At the opposite of classic info-stealers being pushed at an industrial level, this one is widely different in the current landscape/trends. Feeling being in front of a grey box is somewhat a stressful problem, where you have no idea about what it could be behind and how it works, but in another way, it also means that you will learn way more than a usual standard investigation.",

However, unbeknownst to the target, the link leads to a zip file that contains malicious attachments. This blog will highlight the steps taken by an unnamed threat actor targeting the security interests of a former Eastern bloc nation.  Spearphishing emails were sent to various security arms of the Ukrainian government utilizing social engineering lures containing subjects such as: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New COVID-21 Variant\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An Urgent Computer Update\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.

In Greek mythology, Ares is the son of Zeus and grandson of Kronos. Thus, the naming convention appears to refer to this new malware variant as the third generation of Kronos. Ares still appears to be in development alongside an information stealer that harvests credentials from various applications including VPN clients, web browsers, and the malware can exfiltrate arbitrary files and cryptocurrency wallets. The threat actor behind this new variant continues to use both Osiris and Ares in parallel. In this blog post, Zscaler ThreatLabz examines these new malware developments and campaigns.",

This likely reflects the overwhelming dominance of the Windows operating system in businesses and large organizations.

The group has changed target depending on the primary objective. Google TAG has recently published a post about a campaign by Lazarus targeting security researchers. After taking a closer look, we identified the malware used in those attacks as belonging to a family that we call ThreatNeedle. We have seen Lazarus attack various industries using this malware cluster before. In mid-2020, we realized that Lazarus was launching attacks on the defense industry using the ThreatNeedle cluster, an advanced malware cluster of Manuscrypt (a.k.a. NukeSped). While investigating this activity, we were able to observe the complete life cycle of an attack, uncovering more technical details and links to the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other campaigns.\"",

    "Description": "Unit 42 researchers discovered a highly malleable and sophisticated shellcode with behavior and features that strongly correlate with that of the WaterBear malware family, which has been active since as early as 2009. Analysis by Trend Micro and TeamT5 unveiled WaterBear as a multifaceted, stage-two implant, capable of file transfer, shell access, screen capture and much more. The malware is associated with the cyber espionage group BlackTech, which many in the broader threat research community have assessed to have ties to the Chinese government, and is believed to be responsible for recent attacks against several East Asian government organizations. Due to the similarities with WaterBear, and the polymorphic nature of the code, Unit 42 named this novel Chinese shellcode \u00e2\u20ac\u0153BendyBear.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d It stands in a class of its own in terms of being one of the most sophisticated, well-engineered and difficult-to-detect samples of shellcode employed by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).",

Initially, the ransomware was offered as a complete custom build for an undisclosed fee. The ransomware is currently Windows-specific and, according to the developers, functions on all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supported versions of Windows\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nUnusually, there are no connectivity requirements for the payloads to execute. Zeoticus ransomware will execute fully offline, with no dependence on a C2 (Command & Control). It is also worth noting that the malware is designed not to function in some regions, specifically Russia, Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan. Like many other families, use within the CIS is discouraged in order to avoid any backlash from regional government and law enforcement agencies.",

NCC Group and Fox-IT observed this threat actor during various incident response engagements performed between October 2019 until April 2020. Our threat intelligence analysts noticed clear overlap between the various cases in infrastructure and capabilities, and as a result we assess with moderate confidence that one group was carrying out the intrusions across multiple victims operating in Chinese interests.",

They used both publicly available and custom-developed tools that had been seen previously. The hackers, while not changing their TTPs, chose rather unusual software to monetize their attacks. Perhaps the compromise of this client was an accident and this was merely an attempt to obtain at least some benefit. User data was encrypted, after which a ransom demand was made. A mistake in the ransomware's cryptographic algorithms enabled us to recover the encrypted files. To our knowledge, the attackers did not obtain access to information of any value whatsoever, ultimately leaving them with nothing to show for their efforts.\"",

Recently, SANS ISC talked about this vulnerability being exploited in the wild, which you can read about here and here. This vulnerability is very easy to exploit and we assume ransomware actors are using this currently or will be soon.\n\nA threat actor exploited CVE-2020-14882 by making a call to the images directory, which allowed them to execute code on the server. Using this exploit, they downloaded and executed an xml file, which included a PowerShell command to download and execute a script. The script does multiple things, such as download XMRig and its config, rename XMRig to sysupdate, schedule a task for its update process, and confirm the miner is running.",

    "Description": "CISA has recently observed advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploiting multiple legacy vulnerabilities in combination with a newer privilege escalation vulnerability--CVE-2020-1472--in Windows Netlogon. The commonly used tactic, known as vulnerability chaining, exploits multiple vulnerabilities in the course of a single intrusion to compromise a network or application. \n\nCISA is aware of some instances where this activity resulted in unauthorized access to elections support systems; however, CISA has no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been compromised. There are steps that election officials, their supporting SLTT IT staff, and vendors can take to help defend against this malicious cyber activity.",

Although the Agent Tesla RAT has been around for at least 6 years, it continues to adapt and evolve, defeating many organizations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 security efforts. During the COVID-19 pandemic new variants have been introduced with added functionality, and the malware has been widely used in Coronavirus-themed phishing campaigns.",

In addition, we discovered the group using Derusbi, which is a malware family believed to be unique to a small subset of Chinese cyber espionage groups.",

Understanding that normal business processes are critical to organizational success, these ransomware campaigns have been accompanied with multi-million dollar ransom amounts. In this post, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll provide a technical examination of one recent campaign that stems back to a technique that we initially reported on in April 2018.\n\nBetween May and September 2019, FireEye responded to multiple incidents involving a financially-motivated threat actor who leveraged compromised web infrastructure to establish an initial foothold in victim environments. In this newer campaign, the threat actors leveraged victim systems to deploy malware such as Dridex or NetSupport, and multiple post-exploitation frameworks.",

Rocke is actively updating and pushing a new dropper using Pastebin for Command and Control (C2). Recent updates to the C2 as of March 13th, 2019 have been seen, which leads researchers to believe this campaign is ongoing. According to VirusTotal, the threat detection of the new dropper is nearly non-existent. The group has been observed in previous campaigns to use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ld.so.preload\u00e2\u20ac\u009d function to hook libc functions. The hooking is used to hide the dropper and the mining software installed by the malware and prevents it from showing up in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153currently running\u00e2\u20ac\u009d process list.

    "Description": "Last year, Unit 42 wrote about a newly discovered espionage Android malware family, HenBox, which had countless features for spying on their victims \u00e2\u20ac\u201c primarily the Uyghur population \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including interaction with Xiaomi IoT devices, and the Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smart phones. \n\nThrough investigations into infrastructure used by HenBox malware, Unit 42 has discovered another malware family built for the more frequently-targeted Microsoft Windows operating system they named \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFarseer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As with HenBox, Farseer also has infrastructure ties to other malware, such as Poison Ivy, Zupdax, and PKPLUG.  \n\nUnit 42 named this malware Farseer malware due to a string found in the PDB path embedded within the executable files.",

    "Description": "The Sofacy threat group continues to carry out attacks using their Zebrocy tool. We first wrote about the Zebrocy tool in a blog that discussed Sofacy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parallel attack campaigns during the first quarter of 2018, and more recently during Sofacy attacks in late October and early November. The developers of Zebrocy have once again created a new version the Trojan using a different programming language, specifically the Go language. The use of a different programming language to create a functionally similar Trojan is not new to this group, as past Zebrocy variants have been developed in AutoIt, Delphi, VB.NET, C# and Visual C++. While we cannot be certain the impetus for this, we believe the threat group uses multiple languages to create their Trojans to make them differ structurally and visually to make detection more difficult.",

    "Description": "2018 has seen a marked shift away from high-volume, immediately destructive ransomware campaigns to distribution of banking Trojans, information stealers, and downloaders. Banking Trojans now make up almost 60% of malicious payloads we observe in email. Now a new banking Trojan has emerged, adding to the growing diversity of this segment specifically and malicious email campaigns in general.\n\nProofpoint researchers discovered a new banking Trojan, dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DanaBot\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, targeting users in Australia via emails containing malicious URLs. Written in Delphi, the malware is still under active development. To date, we have only observed it in use by a single threat actor. However, it remains to be seen if distribution and use becomes more widespread given that the actor is known for purchasing banking Trojans from other developers and operators. We also found additional samples in malware repositories other than those we observed in the wild, potentially suggesting distribution by other actors.",
