The shift in malware delivery methods to using HTML is concerning, as it challenges email gateway scanners, endpoint protection, and security solutions, especially their ability to unpack, decode and detect such techniques. With HTML smuggling, the malware is concealed from the scanners as most AVs will see the HTML attachment only compared to using an ISO file attachment, which will immediately throw red flags",

The intrusion began with the delivery of an ISO file that contained an LNK and a DLL. The threat actors leveraged BumbleBee to load a Meterpreter agent and Cobalt Strike Beacons. They then performed reconnaissance, used two UAC bypass techniques, dumped credentials, escalated privileges using a ZeroLogon exploit, and moved laterally through the environment.",

This is a significant shift from the malware\u2019s original purpose to enable banking fraud, but is consistent with the broader threat landscape.",

    "Rootkits are malware implants which burrow themselves in the deepest corners of the operating system. Although on paper they may seem attractive to attackers, creating them poses significant technical challenges and the slightest programming error has the potential to completely crash the victim machine. In our APT predictions for 2022, we noted that despite these risks, we expected more attackers to reach the sophistication level required to develop such tools. One of the main draws towards malware nested in such low levels of the operating system is that it is extremely difficult to detect and, in the case of firmware rootkits, will ensure a computer remains in an infected state even if the operating system is reinstalled or the user replaces the machine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard drive entirely.",

    "The Trellix Email Security Research Team has discovered a malicious campaign targeting government agencies of Afghanistan, India, Italy, Poland, and the United States since 2021. The attack starts with a spear phishing email with a geo-political theme. The spear phishing emails were themed around India Afghanistan relationship. Attacker used politics as a lure to trick users into clicking on a malicious link. The email used for this phishing attack contains an attachment or a weaponized URL that delivers an Excel sheet. Upon opening the Excel sheet, Excel executes an embedded malicious macro which then decrypts and installs a Remote Access Trojan (AysncRAT & LimeRAT) and maintains persistence.",

What makes Symbiote different from other Linux malware that they usually come across, is that it needs to infect other running processes to inflict damage on infected machines. Instead of being a standalone executable file that is run to infect a machine, it is a shared object (SO) library that is loaded into all running processes using LD_PRELOAD (T1574.006), and parasitically infects the machine. Once it has infected all the running processes, it provides the threat actor with rootkit functionality, the ability to harvest credentials, and remote access capability.",

    "Spear phishing has always been one of the easiest ways to get into a corporate network. Spear phishing attacks are often used against large corporations, banks, or influencers. The most common targets are high-level employees who have access to rich information, or department employees who need to open a large number of foreign files at work. Generally, the attack file is a macro code written in Microsoft Word or JavaScript code. This kind of file is very small, there is no extra program built into the file, and its sole purpose is to download a more destructive malicious code in the target object's computer. software. After the malware is downloaded, it is further spread in the target network, or it is simply used to steal all available information to help attackers find targets in the network.",

This provides a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sign of life\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to threat actors and indicates that the targeted account is valid with the user being inclined to open emails that utilize social engineering content.

It discusses an unknown threat actor conducting an espionage campaign in Southeast Asia using a new custom malware arsenal. What piqued Fortinet's curiosity most was the mention of a DLL payload loaded from the registry that had yet to be discovered.\n\nThe module is stored as a compressed blob with a custom header in the registry. It is never written to disk, rendering it unlikely to appear in datasets like VirusTotal.\n\nFortinet's have now uncovered a sample of the module and a plethora of components and variants dating as far back as 2017. They have observed the progression of the development of this malware throughout the years. Over time, custom code was added, components were upgraded, capabilities expanded, the code became neater, and modularity increased.\n\nThis blog examines the different components of this malware and their progression over time, thereby mapping the evolution of the Soul malware framework.",

    "Just like the previous year, 2021 ended with COVID and 2022 started with the same. The only difference is that the world is now dealing with the new Omicron variant rather than the Delta variant, which emerged in April 2021. While reportedly less lethal than its predecessor, the Omicron variant has a much higher transmission rate, and as a result, daily counts of new Omicron patients have become a global concern. This has renewed heightened concern about the pandemic, and as we have all sadly learned, threat actors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shy away from using misery and fear to their advantage.\n\nFortiGuard Labs recently came across a curiously named file, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Omicron Stats.exe\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, which turned out to be a variant of Redline Stealer malware.

Although these intrusion sets may appear similar to the new MuddyWater first stage VBS implant used for reconnaissance and profiling activities, they have slightly different TTPs and wider targeting. To date, most of the known victims are located in the Middle East, but there are also targets in other regions",

    "Quick Heal Security Labs has been monitoring various attack campaigns using JSOutProx RAT against different SMBs in the BFSI sector since January 2021. Quick Heal Security Labs has found multiple payloads being dropped at different stages of its operations. Although the RAT campaigns have also been previously reported on other countries, those targeting Indian companies are operated through separate C2 domains.\n\nJSOutProx is a modular JScript-based RAT delivered to the user as a .hta file and first executed by the mshta.exe process. The initial attack vector is a spear-phishing email with a compressed attachment having a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153.hta\u00e2\u20ac\u009d file with a file name related to a financial transaction.

The commonalities include similar domain naming conventions, email lures, Excel file lures, and the delivery of the FlawedGrace remote access trojan (RAT).

The attackers employed two methods. They acquired domains that imitate legitimate ones (newtrendmicro.com, centralgoogle.com, microsoft-support.net, cdn-chrome.com, mcafee-upgrade.com).

After some quick initial investigation, we found that the link was executing a malicious Python script that was used to inject a remote access Trojan (RAT) onto the system.\n\nAlong the way, Huntress encountered a total of six consecutive payloads and some new offensive tooling which we found pretty interesting. Towards the end, Huntress also experimented with some custom scripts for de-obfuscating data and extracting configuration from the final RAT, resulting in some juicy indicators of compromise (IOCs) with 0 detections on VirusTotal (as of June 2021).",

Both of these 0-days were delivered as one-time links sent by email to the targets, all of whom we believe were in Armenia. The links led to attacker-controlled domains that mimicked legitimate websites related to the targeted users. When a target clicked the link, they were redirected to a webpage that would fingerprint their device, collect system information about the client and generate ECDH keys to encrypt the exploits, and then send this data back to the exploit server.",

    "A new modified version of Inter\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe precursor to MobileInter\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwas first reported in March 2020. Since then, Magecart operators have altered it even more. MobileInter, first reported in April 2021, focuses solely on mobile users and targets login credentials and payment data. \nThe first iteration of MobileInter downloaded exfil URLs hidden in images from GitHub repositories. In contrast, this new MobileInter contains the exfiltration URLs within the skimmer code itself and uses WebSockets for data exfil. Hiding its code by injecting it into images on the compromised websites is yet another new wrinkle added by operators.\n\nMobileInter also disguises itself and its infrastructure, leaning heavily on Google to do so. It hides as Google tracking services, uses domains that mimic Google, and abuses Google IPs.",

    "In late 2020, TA453, an Iranian-nexus threat actor, launched a credential phishing campaign targeting senior medical professionals who specialize in genetic, neurology, and oncology research in the United States and Israel. TA453 (aka CHARMING KITTEN and PHOSPHORUS) has historically aligned with Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) collection priorities, targeting dissidents, academics, diplomats, and journalists. This latest campaign, dubbed BadBlood, is a deviation from the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usual activity. While this campaign may represent a shift in TA453 targeting overall, it is also possible it may be the result of a specific short term intelligence collection requirement. BadBlood is aligned with an escalating trend of medical research being increasingly targeted by threat actors.\n\nProofpoint researchers have named this campaign BadBlood based on the medical focus and continued geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel.",

This is the first time we found a Gafgyt variant using the Tor mechanism, so we named the variant Gafgyt_tor. Further analysis revealed that the family is closely related to the Necro family we made public in January, and is behind the same group of people, the so-called keksec group.

Proofpoint has named this malicious browser extension \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FriarFox\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. We attribute this activity to TA413, who in addition to the FriarFox browser extension, was also observed delivering both Scanbox and Sepulcher malware to Tibetan organizations in early 2021. Proofpoint has previously reported on Sepulcher malware and its links to the Lucky Cat and Exile Rat malware campaigns that targeted Tibetan organizations. This actor is believed to be an APT group aligned with the Chinese state with strategic objectives associated with espionage and civil dissident surveillance that includes the Tibetan Diaspora. \"",

    "Recently, CUJO AI has observed ongoing attacks on residential gateways. These attacks have a common trait: they all originated from the same site with the help of malvertising. Once a victim visits this site, they are led through a loop of referrers and redirectors to a malicious JavaScript file. Its end goal is to change the DNS settings on the residential router by initiating a CSRF attack. The victim usually does not detect any malicious activity due to weak device protection and the fact that the attack is executed in the background via hidden iframes and malicious redirectors. This blog presents a case study of home router DNS hijacking in Brazil.",

It has been considered an APT for a long time, however, its characteristics don't match the common definition of an APT. We should consider the possibility of this not being an APT at all, rather being a group that provides services for other APTs, while doing its own attacks on other regions/victimology. Contradicting the usual APT method of operation, Gamaredon does not have a focused victimology and insteads targets users all over the globe. This group is targeting everyone, from banks in Africa to educational institutions in the U.S. The actor is not as stealthy as other major APT actors, and instead acts more like a crimeware gang.",

Avast described a huge campaign composed of dozens of malicious Chrome and Edge browser extensions with more than three million installations in total. Avast alerted both Google and Microsoft about the presence of these malicious extensions on their respective extension stores and are happy to announce that both companies have since taken all of them down as of December 18, 2020.\n\nCacheFlow was notable in particular for the way that the malicious extensions would try to hide their command and control traffic in a covert channel using the Cache-Control HTTP header of their analytics requests. Avast believes this is a new technique. In addition, it appears that the Google Analytics-style traffic was added not just to hide the malicious commands, but that the extension authors were also interested in the analytics requests themselves.",

The malware is associated with the cyber espionage group BlackTech, which many in the broader threat research community have assessed to have ties to the Chinese government, and is believed to be responsible for recent attacks against several East Asian government organizations.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to upload an arbitrary file with arbitrary names and extensions, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the targeted web server.\n\nThis exploit was used by attackers to install webshells, which in turn were used to install Kinsing, malware that runs a malicious cryptominer from the H2miner family. Kinsing is based on the Golang programming language, and its ultimate purpose is to be used in cryptojacking attacks on container environments.",

    "CrimsonIAS is a Delphi-written backdoor dating back to at least 2017 that enables operators to run command line tools, exfiltrate files, and upload files to the infected machine. CrimsonIAS is notable as it listens for incoming connections only; making it different from typical Windows backdoors that beacons out. The characteristics found in CrimsonIAS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s execution flow suggest a connection to Mustang Panda (aka BRONZE PRESIDENT, RedDelta) PlugX samples.  Based on those non-unique characteristics, ThreatConnect assesses with low confidence that CrimsonIAS is an additional tool in Mustang Panda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repertoire.  Industry reporting assesses with varying levels of confidence that Mustang Panda is a Chinese espionage actor that has conducted operations in Mongolia, Vietnam, and Hong Kong among other locations.

    "ESET researchers have discovered a sophisticated backdoor that allows attackers to access sensitive data stored in systems used in the hospitality sector, such as the RES 3700 POS management software, which is used by hundreds of thousands of hotels and restaurants worldwide.\n\nWhat makes the backdoor distinctive are its downloadable modules and their capabilities. One of them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c named GetMicInfo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c contains an algorithm designed to gather database passwords by decrypting them from Windows registry values. This shows that the backdoor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authors have deep knowledge of the targeted software and opted for this sophisticated method instead of collecting the data via a simpler yet \u00e2\u20ac\u0153louder\u00e2\u20ac\u009d approach, such as keylogging.",

    "Towards the end of October, we started seeing attackers take advantage of a WebLogic RCE vulnerability (CVE-2020-14882). Recently, SANS ISC talked about this vulnerability being exploited in the wild, which you can read about here and here. This vulnerability is very easy to exploit and we assume ransomware actors are using this currently or will be soon.\n\nA threat actor exploited CVE-2020-14882 by making a call to the images directory, which allowed them to execute code on the server. Using this exploit, they downloaded and executed an xml file, which included a PowerShell command to download and execute a script. The script does multiple things, such as download XMRig and its config, rename XMRig to sysupdate, schedule a task for its update process, and confirm the miner is running.",

The September attack was part of a low-volume spear phishing attack tracked by Sophos.

    "The Phobos ransomware family is fairly recent, only having been first spotted by security researchers in early 2019. But since then, it has continued to push out new variants that not only evolve attack methods, but also frequently change the extension name of encrypted files in past variants. And in its short history, its victims have often complained that they were cheated by the attacker of Phobos by not restoring files.\n\nTwo weeks ago, FortiGuard Labs captured a new threat sample from the wild. It was a Microsoft Word document with a malicious Macro designed to spread the EKING variant of Phobos. I ran a deep analysis on this sample, and in this analysis post I will show how this variant infects victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s system and how it scans and encrypts files using an AES algorithm on a victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s device as well as shared network folders.",

    "An Old Bot's Nasty New Tricks: Exploring Qbot's Latest Attack Methods",
    "A prominent campaign using QBot ran from March to the end of June this year.   We assumed that the campaign was stopped to allow those behind QBot to conduct further malware development, but we did not imagine that it would return so quickly.\n\nTowards the end of July, one of today's most serious cyber threats, the Emotet Trojan, returned to full activity and launched multiple malspam campaigns, impacting 5% of organizations globally. Some of these campaigns included installing an updated version of Qbot on victims' PCs. A few days later, Checkpoint identified a newer Qbot sample dropped by latest Emotet campaign, which led to discovering a renewed command and control infrastructure and brand new malware techniques distributed through Emotet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infection process.\n\nQbot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s malspam campaign resumed earlier in August, spreading globally and infecting new targets.",

After investigation, it became clear that this newcomer is derived from the code of the Xerxes banking malware, which itself is a strain of the LokiBot Android banking Trojan. The source code of the Xerxes malware was made public by its author around May 2019, which means that it is accessible to any threat actor.",

    "Palo Alto Networks Unit42 identified a malicious Docker Hub account, azurenql, active since October 2019 that was hosting six malicious images intended to mine the cryptocurrency, Monero. The coin mining code within the image intends to evade network detection by using network anonymizing tools such as ProxyChains and Tor. The images hosted on this account have been collectively pulled more than two million times. For context, there are legitimate Azure related images under the official Microsoft Docker Hub account that have anywhere from a few thousand to 100 million+ pulls. One of the wallet IDs identified has been used to earn more than 525.38 XMR, which roughly translates to $36,000 USD.

    "On June 10, Malwarebytes Labs found a malicious Word document disguised as a resume that uses template injection to drop a .Net Loader. This is the first part of a multi-stage attack that we believe is associated to an APT attack. In the last stage, the threat actors used Cobalt Strike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Malleable C2 feature to download the final payload and perform C2 communications.\n\nThis attack is particularly clever for its evasion techniques. For instance, we observed an intentional delay in executing the payload from the malicious Word macro. The goal is not to compromise the victim right away, but instead to wait until they restart their machine. Additionally, by hiding shellcode within an innocuous JavaScript and loading it without touching the disk, this APT group can further thwart detection from security products.",

Furthermore, our research shows that this unknown actor exploited VirtualBox driver version 2.2.0 to target at least two different Russian organizations in 2017, which we are revealing for the first time. We anticipate this was done because the driver version 2.2.0 wasn't known to be vulnerable and thus most likely is not on the radar of security companies being exploited.

During this attack, the adversary abuses two legitimate vendor applications, such as CrystalBit and Apple, as part of a DLL double hijack attack chain that starts with a fraudulent software bundle and eventually leads to a persistent miner and in some cases spyware deployment.\n\nThe abuse of the Apple push notification executable,APSDaemon.exe, is certainly not new. Over the course of more than a year, adversaries have deployed a legitimate and signed copy of the application together with a malicious AppleVersions.dll that is soon loaded by the daemon.

The monetization methods used in such SDKs can pose a threat to users, yet they pull in more revenue for developers than whitelisted ad modules due to the greater number of views. In this post we will look into a few examples of suspicious-looking ad modules that we discovered in popular apps earlier this year.\n\nOne of the applications we researched was a popular app that allows users to ask questions anonymously. Integrated into the code of an earlier version of the app was the module com.haskfm.h5mob.

Despite its simplicity, Raccoon became popular among cybercriminals and was mentioned as a notable emerging malware in underground forums in a malware popularity report.\n\nThe malware is capable of stealing login credentials, credit card information, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser information. Raccoon has basic infostealer functions but an aggressive marketing campaign and overall good user experience proved enough to make up for its lack of additional features. The service is also relatively cheap, with a price that ranged from US$75 per week to $200 per month.\n\nIt can arrive on a system through different delivery techniques such as exploit kits, phishing, and bundled with other malware. In this blog entry we investigate campaigns that used the exploit kits Fallout and Rig, where we also observed its use of Google Drive as part of its evasion tactics.",

These threats are becoming so concerning that the FBI recently had to issue a public warning about one in particular. As ZDNET reported, the US private sector was warned about a malware campaign that targets supply chain software providers. The malware referenced by this report was Kwampirs RAT - the malicious tool of choice from the Orangeworm group.\n\nGiven the possible ramifications this campaign might have, we've decided to leverage the Titanium platform for research into its inner workings. From the threat analysis viewpoint, the most important part of this malware is its configuration (control servers, mutex it uses, registry keys it creates\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6), since it's essentially a remote access trojan (RAT).",

While the first major version of Ursnif was identified in 2006, several subsequent versions have been released in large part due source code leaks. FireEye reported on a previously unidentified variant of the Ursnif malware family to our threat intelligence subscribers in September 2019 after identification of a server that hosted a collection of tools, which included multiple point-of-sale malware families. This malware self-identified as \"SaiGon version 3.50 rev 132,\" and our analysis suggests it is likely based on the source code of the v3 (RM3) variant of Ursnif.

    "In a recent blog post we analysed the first part of an operation likely conducted by APT38/Lazarus, which targeted various organizations, including financial and banking ones. We already described the initial phase of the kill chain where we get to describe the fact that the actor implemented in the operation two different first-stage payloads to be released to the victims on the basis of their system architecture. These payloads are used in order to carry out a first recognition phase. Beyond this, we have already described a first-level backend script used by the threat actor inside a compromised website to manage victims and to release an additional payload if the victims are of interest.",

A developer known as Idea Master has published two popular apps on the Play Store in the past year, with a collective download count of approximately 1.5 million. Symantec has informed Google of the observed behavior and the apps have now been removed from the Play Store.\n\nThe two apps, a notepad app (Idea Note: OCR Text Scanner, GTD, Color Notes) and a fitness app (Beauty Fitness: daily workout, best HIIT coach), are packed using legitimate packers originally developed to protect the intellectual property of Android applications. Android packers can change the entire structure and flow of an Android Package Kit (APK) file, which complicates things for security researchers who want to decipher the APK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavior.

    "Throughout 2018, Proofpoint researchers observed threat actors increasingly distributing downloaders, backdoors, information stealers, remote access trojans (RATs), and more as they abandoned ransomware as their primary payload. In November 2018, TA505, a prolific actor that has been at the forefront of this trend, began distributing a new backdoor we named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ServHelper\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. ServHelper has two variants: one focused on remote desktop functions and a second that primarily functioned as a downloader.\n\nIn June 2019, TA505 appears to have introduced yet another new downloader malware, AndroMut, which has some similarities in code and behavior to Andromeda, a long-established malware family. Proofpoint research has observed AndroMut download malware referred to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FlawedAmmyy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d FlawedAmmyy is a full-featured RAT that was first observed in early 2016 and is based on the leaked source code of a legitimate shareware tool, Ammyy.",

    "In April 2019, Unit 42 observed the Emissary Panda (AKA APT27, TG-3390, Bronze Union, Lucky Mouse) threat group installing webshells on Sharepoint servers to compromise Government Organizations of two different countries in the Middle East. Unit 42 believes the adversary exploited a recently patched vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint tracked by CVE-2019-0604, which is a remote code execution vulnerability used to compromise the server and eventually install a webshell. The actors uploaded a variety of tools that they used to perform additional activities on the compromised network, such as dumping credentials,  as well as locating and pivoting to additional systems on the network. Of particular note is their use of tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144, which is the same vulnerability exploited by EternalBlue that is best known for its use in the WannaCry attacks of 2017.",

    "Over the past few months, a new malware loader called JasperLoader has emerged that targets Italy and other European countries with banking trojans such as Gootkit. Talos recently released a comprehensive analysis of the functionality associated with JasperLoader. Shortly after the publication of their analysis, the distribution activity associated with these campaigns halted. But after several weeks of relatively low volumes of activity, they discovered a new version of JasperLoader being spread. This new version features several changes and improvements from the initial version they analyzed. JasperLoader is typically used to infect systems with additional malware payloads which can be used to exfiltrate sensitive information, damage systems or otherwise negatively impact organizations.",

Newly associated samples from April 2019 indicate attackers have added three distinct steps to their operations, allowing them to bypass certain security controls and suggesting that MuddyWater&#39;s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) have evolved to evade detection. If successful, this campaign would install a PowerShell-based backdoor onto the victim&#39;s machine, giving the threat actors remote access. While this activity indicates the threat actor is taking steps to improve its operational security and avoid endpoint detection, the underlying code remains unchanged. The findings outlined in this blog should help threat hunting teams identify MuddyWater&#39;s latest TTPs.",

    "AlienLabs has seen a number of reports of active exploitation of a vulnerability in Microsoft Sharepoint (CVE-2019-0604).\nOne report by the Saudi Cyber Security Centre appears to be primarily targeted at organisations within the kingdom.\nAn earlier report by the Canadian Cyber Security Centre identified similar deployment of the tiny China Chopper web-shell to gain an initial foothold.\nAlienLabs has identified malware (https://pastebin.com/bUFPhucz) that is likely an earlier version of the second-stage malware deployed in the Saudi Intrusions.\nThis malware sample was shared by a target in China. The malware receives commands at http://$SERVER/Temporary_Listen_Addresses/SMSSERVICE  - and has the ability to:\n- Execute commands.\n- Download and upload files.\nOne user on twitter has reported that they have seen exploitation from the IP address 194.36.189[.]177 - which we have also seen acting as a command and control server for malware linked to FIN7. \nA patch for the vulnerability is available from Microsoft.",

    "Malwarebytes has been closely monitoring the situation involving the continued attacks against users of the popular Electrum Bitcoin wallet. Initially, victims were being tricked to download a fraudulent update that stole their cryptocurrencies. Later on, the threat actors launched a series of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in response to Electrum developers trying to protect their users.\n\nSince their last blog, the amount of stolen funds has increased to USD $4.6 million, and the botnet that is flooding the Electrum infrastructure is rapidly growing. Case in point, on April 24, the number of infected machines in the botnet was just below 100,000 and the next day it reached its highest at 152,000, according to this online tracker. Since then, it has gone up and down and plateaued at around the 100,000 mark.",

Message signing is not the same as message encryption and is used only to validate the identity of the message sender not to guarantee the confidentiality of the message itself.

In February, Talos discovered some changes to the actors and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), including the use of a new reconnaissance phase that selectively chooses which targets to infect with malware.

Both vulnerabilities are present in all versions of Social Warfare prior to 3.5.3: a fix was released on 21 March and an estimated 42,000 websites are potentially vulnerable until they update to 3.5.3. An attacker can use these vulnerabilities to run arbitrary PHP code and control the website and the server without authentication.

DNS is a foundational technology supporting the Internet. Manipulating that system has the potential to undermine the trust users have in the Internet. That trust, and the stability of the DNS system as a whole, drives the global economy. Responsible nations should avoid targeting this system, work together to establish an accepted global norm that this system and the organizations that control it are off-limits, and cooperate in pursuing those actors who act irresponsibly by targeting this system.",

    "Spear Phishing Campaign Targets Ukraine Government and Military",
    "In early 2019, FireEye Threat Intelligence identified a spear phishing email targeting government entities in Ukraine. The spear phishing email included a malicious LNK file with PowerShell script to download the second-stage payload from the command and control (C&amp;C) server. The email was received by military departments in Ukraine and included lure content related to the sale of demining machines. \n\nThis latest activity is a continuation of spear phishing that targeted the Ukrainian Government as early as 2014. The email is linked to activity that previously targeted the Ukrainian Government with RATVERMIN. Infrastructure analysis indicates the actors behind the intrusion activity may be associated with the so-called Luhansk People&#39;s Republic (LPR).",

Initially observed in China in early 2019, the methods it previously used to infect networks involved accessing weak passwords and using pass-the-hash technique, Windows admin tools, and brute force attacks with publicly available codes. However, this new case we found in Japan involves the use of the EternalBlue exploit and the abuse of PowerShell to break into the system and evade detection.\n\nIt appears that the attackers are now expanding this botnet to other countries; TrendMicro telemetry has since detected this threat in Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and India.",

    "Cylance researchers uncovered a novel payload loader that utilizes steganography to read an encrypted payload concealed within a .png image file. The steganography algorithm appears to be bespoke and utilizes a least significant bit approach to minimize visual differences when compared with the original image to prevent analysis by discovery tools. Once decoded, decrypted, and executed, an obfuscated loader will load one of the APT32 backdoors. Thus far, BlackBerry Cylance has observed two backdoors being used in combination with the steganography loader \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a version of Denes backdoor (bearing similarities to the one described by ESET), and an updated version of Remy backdoor. However, this can be easily modified by the threat actor to deliver other malicious payloads. The complexity of the shellcode and loaders shows the group continues to invest heavily in development of bespoke tooling.",

    "As 2018 drew to a close and 2019 took over, I began to see a different behavior from SMB malware authors.

    "From Fileless Techniques to Using Steganography: Examining Powloads Evolution",
    "Powload\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staying power in the threat landscape shows how far it has come. In fact, the uptick of macro malware in the first half of 2018 was due to Powload, which was distributed via spam emails. Powload was also one of the most pervasive threats in the North American region in 2018, using various techniques to deliver payloads such as the information-stealing Emotet, Bebloh, and Ursnif. Our Powload detections and the number of related cases/incidents and unique samples we analyzed in 2018 also markedly increased compared to 2017. Powload\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evolving techniques, on the other hand, show how far it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go. While its use of spam email as a distribution method could be its constant, it has employed different ways of delivering payloads, from bypassing mitigations like a document\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preview mode to using fileless techniques and hijacking email accounts.",

    "Since the Mirai botnet source code was leaked in 2016, it was inevitable that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see its variants being put to use in IoT threat campaigns. Apart from using brute-force techniques to attack IoT devices through various protocols, the botnet also seems to be leveraging vulnerabilities present in IoT devices to infect other IoT devices. These vulnerabilities are mostly in management frameworks and, by exploiting them, attackers are achieving remote code execution. This typically results in turning the infected device into a bot which in turn forms a bigger botnet army. In some cases, we also saw cryptominers as the final payload delivered in the IoT campaigns.",

The use of a different programming language to create a functionally similar Trojan is not new to this group, as past Zebrocy variants have been developed in AutoIt, Delphi, VB.NET, C# and Visual C++. While we cannot be certain the impetus for this, we believe the threat group uses multiple languages to create their Trojans to make them differ structurally and visually to make detection more difficult.",

More recently, its authors have integrated a VB Script exploit, CVE-2018-8174 [2], which has been used used in limited email campaigns. Finally, at the end of November, LCG Kit added the ability to use Microsoft Word macros instead of exploits to load the shellcode responsible for installing malware payloads.\n\nDue to the widespread appearance of malicious attachments created with LCG Kit in a number of email campaigns,, we presume that it may be for sale on underground forums.

The majority of targets were NATO-aligned nation states, although several former USSR nation states were also targeted. The attacks primarily deployed variants of the Zebrocy tool, which we have previously analyzed. A smaller subset of the delivery documents  delivered Cannon or a Zebrocy Delphi variant as reported by ESET. Since we began tracking the use of Zebrocy going back to mid-2015, we have observed a significant increase in frequency of deployment of this tool.

It also provides details on two different threat actors using the MaaS that fall under the umbrella of a family we dubbed Golden Chickens: GC01 and GC02. The success of GC operations heavily relies on a specific MaaS sold in underground forums, which provides customers with the malwares and the infrastructure they need for targeted attacks.

After getting the proper URL, it takes another 4 packet exchanges for the attacker to figure out where the shellcode&#39;s execution start address in memory is so a right exploit payload can be crafted and fed to the target.\n\nAt the beginning we were not able to capture a valid sample as the honeypot needs to be able to simulate the above scenarios. We had to tweak and customize our honeypot quite a few times, then finally in Oct, we got it right and successfully tricked the botnet to send us the sample (we call it BCMUPnP_Hunter).",

At the time, we wrote that the trojan seemed to be in the testing stages of development, based on the malware&#39;s code patterns, strings and telemetry visibility. Since then, we discovered that there&#39;s already a predecessor to GPlayed, which we are calling &quot;GPlayed Banking.&quot; Unlike the first version of GPlayed, this is not an all-encompassing banking trojan. It is specifically a banking trojan that&#39;s looking to target Sberbank AutoPay users, a service offered by the Russian state-owned bank.\n\nGPlayed Banking is spread in a similar way to the original GPlayed. It&#39;s disguised as a fake Google app store, but actually installs the malware once it&#39;s launched. This further illustrates the point that Android users need to be educated on how to spot a malicious app, and that they should be careful as to what privileges they assign to certain programs.",

In recent years, such imposters have often been poorly-disguised malware executables or script-based downloaders designed to install cryptocurrency miners, information stealers, or ransomware. If a victim runs such poorly-disguised malware on a vulnerable Windows host, no visible activity happens, unless the fake updater is pushing ransomware.\n\nHowever, a recent type of fake Flash update has implemented additional deception. As early as August 2018, some samples impersonating Flash updates have borrowed pop-up notifications from the official Adobe installer.

    "FireEye has been tracking a campaign this year targeting web payment portals that involves on-premise installations of Click2Gov. Click2Gov is a web-based, interactive self-service bill-pay software solution developed by Superion. It includes various modules that allow users to pay bills associated with various local government services such as utilities, building permits, and business licenses. In October 2017, Superion released a statement confirming suspicious activity had affected a small number of customers. In mid-June 2018, numerous media reports referenced at least seven Click2Gov customers that were possibly affected by this campaign. Since June 2018, additional victims have been identified in public reporting. A review of public statements by these organizations appear to confirm compromises associated with Click2Gov.",

Through the use of mobile applications, those behind the attack use fake decoy content to entice their victims to download such applications, which are in fact loaded with spyware, to then collect sensitive information about them.

This POS malware is named as such after the debug path left in the sample.\nRtPOS is unique in comparison to other fully featured POS malware like Project Hook and TreasureHunter, in that it has no native exfiltration capability. While other POS malware families are perfectly capable of sending captured Track1 and Track2 data to a C2 server, RtPOS merely saves the data locally. As this activity is similar to some POS utilities, this is likely intended to reduce the network activity footprint of RtPOS and ensure the malware remains undetected for longer, thus earning the controllers a healthier profit.

So far the campaign has targeted several enterprises, while encrypting hundreds of PC, storage and data centers in each infected company.\n\n\nCuriously, our research lead us to connect the nature of Ryuk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign and some of its inner-workings to the HERMES ransomware, a malware commonly attributed to the notorious North Korean APT Lazarus Group, which was also used in massive targeted attacks.

To date, we have only collected 14 samples of this variant, indicating it may be sparingly used.

    "AZORult is a robust information stealer and downloader that Proofpoint researchers originally identified in 2016 as part of a secondary infection via the Chthonic banking Trojan. We have since observed many instances of AZORult dropped via exploit kits and in fairly regular email campaigns as both a primary and secondary payload. Recently, AZORult authors released a substantially updated version, improving both on its stealer and downloader functionality. It is noteworthy that within a day of the new update appearing on underground forums, a prolific actor used the new version in a large email campaign, leveraging its new capabilities to distribute Hermes ransomware. It is always interesting to see malware campaigns where both a stealer and ransomware are present, as this is less common, and especially disruptive for recipients who initially may have credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and more stolen before losing access to their files in a subsequent ransomware attack.",

One of the most popular techniques is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fileless\u00e2\u20ac\u009d attack. Because these attacks are launched through reputable executables, they are hard to detect. Both consumers and corporate users can fall victim to this threat. In corporate environments, attackers use this vector to move laterally through the network.\n\nOne fileless threat, CactusTorch, uses the DotNetToJScript technique, which loads and executes malicious .NET assemblies straight from memory. These assemblies are the smallest unit of deployment of an application, such as a .dll or .exe. As with other fileless attack techniques, DotNetToJScript does not write any part of the malicious .NET assembly on a computer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard drive; hence traditional file scanners fail to detect these attacks.",

Posing to be from the Palestinian Political and National Guidance Commission, the Word document serves as a decoy, distracting victims while the malware is installed in the background.",

    "In March and April 2018, Volexity identified multiple spear phishing campaigns attributed to Patchwork, an Indian APT group also known as Dropping Elephant. This increase in threat activity was consistent with other observations documented over the last few months in blogs by 360 Threat Intelligence Center analyzing attacks on Chinese organizations and Trend Micro noting targets in South Asia. From the attacks observed by Volexity, what is most notable is that Patchwork has pivoted its targeting and has launched attacks directly against US-based think tanks. Volexity has also found that, in addition to sending malware lures, the Patchwork threat actors are leveraging unique tracking links in their e-mails for the purpose of identifying which recipients opened their e-mail messages.",

Banking Trojans now make up almost 60% of malicious payloads we observe in email. Now a new banking Trojan has emerged, adding to the growing diversity of this segment specifically and malicious email campaigns in general.\n\nProofpoint researchers discovered a new banking Trojan, dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DanaBot\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, targeting users in Australia via emails containing malicious URLs. Written in Delphi, the malware is still under active development. To date, we have only observed it in use by a single threat actor. However, it remains to be seen if distribution and use becomes more widespread given that the actor is known for purchasing banking Trojans from other developers and operators.

Fancy Bear actors typically choose geopolitical targets, such as governments and international organizations. They also target industries that do business with such organizations, such as defense contractors.  Lojack, formally known as Computrace, is a legitimate laptop recovery solution used by a number of companies to protect their assets should they be stolen.  Lojack makes an excellent double-agent due to appearing as legit software while natively allowing remote code execution.

In some cases, the payload was the NetSupport Manager remote access tool (RAT). NetSupport Manager is a commercially available RAT that can be used legitimately by system administrators for remotely accessing client computers. However, malicious actors are abusing this application by installing it to the victims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 systems without their knowledge to gain unauthorized access to their machines. This blog details our analysis of the JavaScript and components used in instances where the identified payload was NetSupport RAT.",

    "As 2018 begins, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve witnessed an increased trend in cryptocurrency miners. The latest identified threat comes in the form of a Russian BitTorrent site that is covertly distributing malware, primarily mining the Monero cryptocurrency, to its users. This particular Russian BitTorrent site, b-tor[.]ru, has been active since July 2017, and has been observed bundling malware with legitimate files served to its users since September 2017. Like many similar operations, the cryptocurrency miners are delivered without the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge. In fact, the operator behind this attack makes specific attempts to ensure that the end user doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize that malware has been loaded on his or her machine.",

    "The RAT is impacting users of a Brazilian public sector management school.\n\nThe samples of two different versions of this RAT, both versions (3.0 and 4.0 according to the information within the samples analyzed) were written using Python and packed into an executable using a common tool called py2exe. The malware main script bytecode is stored in a portable executable (PE) section called PYTHONSCRIPT, while the Python DLL is stored in a section called PYTHON27.DLL. All the remaining modules&#39; bytecode is compressed and stored in the executable overlay.\n\nBoth versions have all the usual RAT capabilities, however, during our investigation it became clear that version 4.0 (the latest) is a stripped-down version, where some features were removed, as explained later, to be part of a targeted campaign.\n\nThe target of such campaign are the users of INESAP - Instituto Nacional Escola Superior da Administra\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o P\u00c3\u00bablica, which is a Brazilian public sector management school that also does consulting work.",

We have also observed that the motivation for many of the modifications to Mirai is to earn more money. Mirai was originally designed for DDoS attack, but later modifications were used to target vulnerable ETH mining rigs to mine cryptocurrency. \n\nIn October 2016, an article was published by Brian Krebs about how cybercriminals earn money by converting IoT devices into proxy servers.  Cybercriminals use proxies to add anonymity when doing various dirty work such as cyber theft, hacking into a system, etc. One way to earn money with proxy servers is to sell the access to these servers to other cybercriminals.

    "Throughout the past couple of years ransomware has dominated the threat landscape and for good reason. It creates a highly profitable business model that allows attackers to directly monetize their nefarious activities. However, there are a couple of limitations with the use of ransomware. First is the fact that only a small percentage of infected users will actually pay the ransom demanded by the attacker. Second, as systems and technology get better at detecting and blocking ransomware attacks the pool of possible victims is changing. Potential victims in many countries lack the financial capabilities to pay $300-$500 to retrieve their data. Possibly related to these aforementioned limitations, we have begun to see a steady shift in the payloads that are being delivered.

    "On January 24, 2018, we observed that the number of Coinhive web miner detections tripled due to a malvertising campaign. We discovered that advertisements found on high-traffic sites not only used Coinhive (detected by Trend Micro as JS_COINHIVE.GN), but also a separate web miner that connects to a private pool. Attackers abused Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DoubleClick, which develops and provides internet ad serving services, for traffic distribution. Data from the Trend Micro\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Smart Protection Network\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 shows affected countries include Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy, and Spain. We have already disclosed our findings to Google.\n\nWe detected an almost 285% increase in the number of Coinhive miners on January 24. We started seeing an increase in traffic to five malicious domains on January 18. After closely examining the network traffic, we discovered that the traffic came from DoubleClick advertisements.",

The exploit implementation includes Chinese terms possibly signifying an attempted false flag or a Chinese exploit supplier.",

In the past few months, we have seen one or two fake apps per week attacking Android devices to make unsuspecting victims download the malware.

However in this campaign, the binary payload, which was later found to be a NanoCore RAT client, is actually embedded in the obfuscated HTA.

BankBot is particularly risky because it disguises itself as legitimate banking apps, typically using fake overlay screens to mimic existing banking apps and steal user credentials. BankBot is also capable of hijacking and intercepting SMS messages, which means that it can bypass SMS-based 2-factor authentication.\n\nThroughout the year, Bankbot has been distributed as benign apps, some of which made their way onto popular app stores. In April and July of 2017, Bankbot-infected apps were detected posing as entertainment and online banking apps on Google Play. More than twenty were found and exposed during the said months.",

The Lazarus group, which has been identified as the backbone of the report, has been active in the past, and Novetta &amp;#39;s research is helping to preemptively counteract and prevent Lazarus attacks around the world. However, global security companies are limited in collecting attack information in Korea, and there is also a lack of information about the attacks that Lazarus or Lazarus are suspected of as a small group of threat groups in Korea. Therefore, the Korea Financial Security Institute (FSI) identified the specific characteristics of domestic IT and work environment, and profiled specific threat groups that are using the attacks.

Antivirus often detects the associated malware as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Banload,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d a family of Trojans that downloads other malware. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve identified 9,215 samples tagged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Banload\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in AutoFocus since December 2013. Of these Banload samples, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen 2,132 samples during the first six months of 2017.",

The malware, dubbed &quot;CopyCat&quot; by researchers, uses a novel technique to generate and steal ad revenues. This extensive campaign infected over 14 million devices, rooting 8 million of them with an unprecedented success rate. The malware reached a global spread, infecting mostly users from south-east Asia, but also over 280,000 users in the US. We estimate that through the malware&#39;s malicious activities, the\nperpetrators behind it gained over $1.5 million over the course of two months. CopyCat is a fully\ndeveloped malware with vast capabilities, including elevating privileges to root, establishing persistency, and to top it all - injecting code into Zygote. Zygote is a daemon whose goal is to launch apps on Android, and injecting code into it allows the malware to intervene in any activity on the device.",

In cooperation with Cisco Advanced Services Incident Response, Talos identified several key aspects of the attack. The investigation found a supply chain-focused attack at M.E.Doc software that delivered a destructive payload disguised as ransomware. By utilizing stolen credentials, the actor was able to manipulate the update server for M.E.Doc to proxy connections to an actor-controlled server. Based on the findings, Talos remains confident that the attack was destructive in nature. The effects were broad reaching, with Ukraine Cyber police confirming over 2000 affected companies in Ukraine alone.",

    "Throughout 2015 and 2016, Android banking Trojans were primarily distributed outside the Google Play Store by using SMSishing, phishing e-mails and rogue websites, often dropping APKs related to Adobe Flash Player. \n\nThe focus of the Android banking malware in Google Play is different from any other Android malware we have investigated. Usually, Android banking malware is spread with the goal to convince users to install it based on the top rated app name and icon such as &#39;Super Mario Run&#39;, &#39;Flash Player&#39; or &#39;WhatsApp&#39;. The approach of the Google Play campaigns is different: everything is designed to gain the trust of the user. Even a fake Facebook profile to pretend to be an actual company, aided in this process. After the installation, the application does not immediately show its true colours, in fact the malicious activities are postponed for a couple of minutes so users can for example first use the app to open funny videos or watch the latest news.",

Analyzing malware is often like solving a puzzle, you have to do it piece by piece to reach the final image. In this case I spent more time analyzing the campaign than I initially planned.

    "Recently, FireEye identified three new zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office products that are being exploited in the wild.\nAt the end of March 2017, we detected another malicious document leveraging an unknown vulnerability in EPS and a recently patched vulnerability in Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) to drop malware. Following the April 2017 Patch Tuesday, in which Microsoft disabled EPS, FireEye detected a second unknown vulnerability in EPS.\n\nFireEye believes that two actors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Turla and an unknown financially motivated actor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were using the first EPS zero-day (CVE-2017-0261), and APT28 was using the second EPS zero-day (CVE-2017-0262) along with a new Escalation of Privilege (EOP) zero-day (CVE-2017-0263). Turla and APT28 are Russian cyber espionage groups that have used these zero-days against European diplomatic and military entities. The unidentified financial group targeted regional and global banks with offices in the Middle East.",

    "In one of our previous blog entries, we covered how the threat actor known as Winnti was using GitHub to spread malware \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a development that shows how the group is starting to evolve and use new attack methods beyond their previous tactics involving targeted attacks against gaming, pharmaceutical, and telecommunications companies. Through this entry, in which we take a closer look at an individual who we believe might be connected to the Winnti group, we hope to give both ordinary users and organizations better insights into some of the tools \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably the server infrastructures- these kinds of threat actors use, as well as the scale in which they operate.",

    "The iOS ecosystem is usually described as a closed ecosystem, under the strict control of Apple. However, there are still ways to get around this tight control. Remember the Haima app? That method relied on enterprise certificates from Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich are costly, since the certificates needed are changed very frequently.\n\nWe are currently seeing how third-party app stores are improving. Recently, we saw an app that leads to a third-party app store being offered on the official iOS App Store. To evade detection, this app was concealed as a legitimate app. In at least one case, an app used for jailbreaking was available via this third-party app store.",

In this post we describe the technical details about a newly observed campaign of the notorious Crypt0l0cker (aka TorrentLocker or Teerac) ransomware. Crypt0l0cker has gone through a long evolution, the adversaries are updating and improving the malware on a regular basis. Several indicators inside the samples we have analysed point to a new major version of the malware. We have already seen large campaigns targeting Europe and other parts of the world in 2014 and 2015. It seems to be that the actors behind these campaigns are back now and launching again massive spam attacks.

Interestingly enough, Sourcefire was the only security vendor directly referenced in the Powershell script. We searched for the base64 encoded value which was referenced in the tweet, and were able to identify a sample that had been uploaded to the public malware analysis sandbox, Hybrid Analysis. Additionally, when we searched for the decoded string value we found a single search engine result that pointed to a Pastebin page. The hash listed in the Pastebin led us to a malicious Word document that had also been uploaded to a public sandbox. The Word document initiated the same multiple-stage infection process as the file from the Hybrid Analysis report we previously discovered and allowed us to reconstruct a more complete infection process.",

Also of particular interest from an attribution obfuscation perspective is direct IP crossover with previous Dynamic DNS domains associated with known CN-APT activity.

    "Magic Hound Campaign Attacks Saudi Targets",
    "Unit 42 has discovered a persistent attack campaign operating primarily in the Middle East dating back to at least mid-2016 which we have named Magic Hound. This appears to be an attack campaign focused on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either in in or business interests in Saudi Arabia. The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks. Link analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rocket Kitten\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (AKA Operation Saffron Rose, Ajax Security Team, Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called Newscasters.",

Although malware targeting the Android OS stopped being a novelty quite some time ago, this trojan is quite unique. Instead of attacking a user, it attacks the Wi-Fi network the user is connected to, or, to be precise, the wireless router that serves the network. The trojan, dubbed Trojan.AndroidOS.Switcher, performs a brute-force password guessing attack on the router\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s admin web interface. If the attack succeeds, the malware changes the addresses of the DNS servers in the router\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s settings, thereby rerouting all DNS queries from devices in the attacked Wi-Fi network to the servers of the cybercriminals (such an attack is also known as DNS-hijacking).

As 2016 comes to a close, we observe the same thing happening to another of Nintendo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game properties: Super Mario.\n\nIn advance of any official release, cybercriminals have already released their own Mario-related apps. Since 2012, we have found more than 9,000 apps using the Mario name on various sources online. About two-thirds of these apps show some kind of malicious behavior, including displaying ads and downloading apps without the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consent.",

    "Arsenal is currently developing a detailed case study related to our analysis of computers essential to the Odatv case in Turkey. Odatv is a secular news organization founded in 2007 with a reputation for being critical of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government and the G\u00c3\u00bclen Movement. Prosecutors in this case have alleged that Odatv journalists (and others) were members of the Ergenekon terrorist organization, based on documents recovered from two particular computers. We have found that those computers, used by Odatv journalists Bar\u00c4\u00b1\u00c5\u0178 Pehlivan and M\u00c3\u00bcyesser Y\u00c4\u00b1ld\u00c4\u00b1z, were attacked in a relentless (and fascinating) fashion - ultimately resulting in placement of the incriminating documents just prior to seizure by the Turkish National Police. We will be sharing our findings as we are able on this page and perhaps even open sourcing some aspects of our analysis.",

Unlike other ATM malware families, Alice cannot be controlled via the numeric pad of ATMs; neither does it have information stealing features.

The worst affected were companies in the smelting, electric power generation and transmission, construction, and engineering industries. Most of the organizations attacked were vendors of industrial automation solutions and system support contractors. In other words, the attack targeted organizations that design, build and support industrial solutions for critical infrastructure. Based on the data we have acquired since October 2016, about 500 organizations from 50 countries were affected by the attack.\n\nThe emails had subject lines that were intended to convince unsuspecting recipients that they were from a legitimate source.

    "On a lazy Sunday morning we got a message from one of our Polish readers about a strange behavior of his home router. The router rebooted every 15 to 20 minutes. The reader looked at the config and realized that his router got a new, suspicious entry in the NTP server name field, namely\nThe attacker decided to prepare 3 different binaries to cover 3 different architectures. The injected code attempts to download them all and execute.\nShodan tells us that more than 5 million devices make their TR-069 service available to the outside world. That number is likely inflated, mainly because of dynamic IP allocation and historic records not being removed promptly. It is worth noting that this number only shows hosts potentially vulnerable to the first exploit, while the second one is also required to execute code on the router or modem. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the statistics of devices vulnerable to both issues at the same time.",

However, beginning on September 22, 2016, we detected the first large-scale email campaign distributing MarsJoke. This ongoing campaign appears to target primarily state and local government agencies and educational institutions in the United States.\n\nThe targeting of state and local government agencies as well as the distribution methods are very similar to a CryptFile2 campaign we described in August [2]. Gary Warners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog also reported on this and similar campaigns, indicating that a well-known botnet, Kelihos, is responsible for distributing this spam [4][5][6].",

The Trojan is delivered in emails that mostly target corporate users. After a successful infection, RAA executes its main task, i.e. encrypts the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s files.

    "Remote Administration Tools (RAT) have been around for a long time.

In this age of global operations, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge deal. From troubleshooting machines across countries to observing employees across rooms, RAT solutions have become widely used tools for remote maintenance and monitoring.\n\nUnfortunately, malware authors often utilize these same capabilities to compromise systems.

The Fidelis Threat Research team recently analyzed a new variant to Vawtrak using HTTPS for C2 communications. Given what we&#39;ve seen previously with Vawtrak, simply switching to HTTPS is not a major update in terms of development -- but it does show that the threat actors are interested in protecting their C2 communications.\n\nHere are some significant updates to Vawtrak:\n\n- The malware now includes a DGA. Interestingly, it utilizes a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) used in Vawtrak&#39;s loader.\n- The DGA hosted site further serves up a list of domains that are cycled through for C2. In this respect, Vawtrak now has a 2-tier C2 discovery infrastructure.\n- It also includes SSL certificate checking (aka SSL pinning), allowing it to evade scenarios in which an SSL man-in-the-middle is present.

The themes of the messages used in the attacks are related to IT Infrastructure such as a log of Server Status Report or a list of Cisco Iron Port Appliance details. In one case, the content of the email appeared to be a legitimate email conversation between several employees, even containing contact details of employees from several banks. This email was then forwarded to several people, with the malicious Excel file attached.\nAnother interesting technique leveraged by this malware was the use of DNS queries as a data exfiltration channel.

At the peak of procrastinators filing their taxes at the last minute, those who send in their tax forms are exactly the technically less-sophisticated users these kinds of campaigns target.  \n\nWe rapidly determined that this spam campaign was attempting to broadly deliver TeslaCrypt 4.1A to individuals.  In the subsequent sections, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll detail the various stages of the TeslaCrypt 4.1A attack chain, moving from infiltration to detection evasion, anti-analysis and evasion features, entrenchment, and the malicious mission, concluding with some points on the user experience.",

    "FireEye recently discovered a new variant of a point of sale (POS) malware family known as NewPosThings. This variant, which we call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MULTIGRAIN\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, consists largely of a subset of slightly modified code from NewPosThings. The variant is highly targeted, digitally signed, and exfiltrates stolen payment card data over DNS. The addition of DNS-based exfiltration is new for this malware family; however, other POS malware families such as BernhardPOS and FrameworkPOS have used this technique in the past.\n\nUsing DNS for data exfiltration provides several advantages to the attacker. Sensitive environments that process card data will often monitor, restrict, or entirely block the HTTP or FTP traffic often used for exfiltration in other environments. While these common internet protocols may be disabled within a restrictive card processing environment, DNS is still necessary to resolve hostnames within the corporate environment and is unlikely to be blocked.",

The attackers behind this campaign went to some lengths to disguise their activities, including using domains names disguised as antivirus (AV) company websites for their command and control (C&amp;C) servers.

But during a recent investigation we found a backdoor that takes a very different approach. We refer to this backdoor as T9000, which is a newer variant of the T5000 malware family, also known as Plat1.\nIn addition to the basic functionality all backdoors provide, T9000 allows the attacker to capture encrypted data, take screenshots of specific applications and specifically target Skype users. The malware goes to great lengths to identify a total of 24 potential security products that may be running on a system and customizes its installation mechanism to specifically evade those that are installed. It uses a multi-stage installation process with specific checks at each point to identify if it is undergoing analysis by a security researcher.\nThe primary functionality of this tool is to gather information about the victim.",

    "Threat actors with strategic interest in the affairs of other governments and civil society organizations have been launching targeted exploitation campaigns for years. Typically, these campaigns leverage spear phishing as the delivery vector and often include malicious attachments designed to bypass typical detection controls. In other cases, spear phish directs users to websites that would otherwise be trusted but actually have been compromised by threat actors seeking greater access to fulfill their actions and objectives.",

    "FireEye Threat Intelligence analysts identified a spear phishing campaign carried out in August 2015 targeting Hong Kong-based media organizations. A China-based cyber threat group, which FireEye tracks as an uncategorized advanced persistent threat (APT) group and other researchers refer to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153admin@338,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d may have conduced the activity.[1] The email messages contained malicious documents with a malware payload called LOWBALL. LOWBALL abuses the Dropbox cloud storage service for command and control (CnC). We collaborated with Dropbox to investigate the threat, and our cooperation revealed what may be a second, similar operation. The attack is part of a trend where threat groups hide malicious activity by communicating with legitimate web services such as social networking and cloud storage sites to foil detection efforts.[2][3]",

    "Symantec has found that South Korea is being impacted by an active back door Trojan, detected as Backdoor.Duuzer. While the malware attack has not been exclusively targeting the region, it has been focusing on the South Korean manufacturing industry. Duuzer is a well-designed threat that gives attackers remote access to the compromised computer, downloads additional files, and steals data. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly the work of skilled attackers looking to obtain valuable information\n\nThere is also evidence to suggest that the actors behind Duuzer are spreading two other threats, detected as W32.Brambul and Backdoor.Joanap, to target more organizations in South Korea.

    "Mobile app creators are often looking for ways to monetize their software. One of the most common ways to do this is by displaying advertisements to users or by offering in-app purchases (IAPs). Mobile monetization platforms create software libraries that authors can embed into their apps to start earning money quickly. We previously highlighted the dangers of installing apps that enable IAPs using SMS messages, as these apps typically have access to all SMS messages sent to the phone.\nWhile not all SMS-based IAP applications steal user data, we recently identified that the Chinese Taomike SDK has begun capturing copies of all messages received by the phone and sending them to a Taomike controlled server. Since August 1, Palo Alto Networks WildFire has captured over 18,000 Android apps that contain this library. These apps are not hosted inside the Google Play store, but are distributed via third party distribution mechanisms in China.",

    "In July 2015, Check Point\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Incident Response team was contacted by a customer after they noticed strange file system activities in one of their Linux-based DNS BIND servers. This strange behavior consisted of a large amount of peculiar files being written into sensitive system directories. A thorough analysis of the infected system by our Incident Response and Malware Research teams quickly revealed that the server was indeed compromised. The source of this compromise was traced to an SSH brute force attack that took place earlier the same month. The attacking IP addresses originated from very distinctive network ranges mostly associated with Chinese Internet  service providers. Using this SSH brute-forcing network, it took the attackers only a few days to gain root access and full control of the targeted server. Once they obtained access to the server, the  attackers infected the system with two malicious payloads.",

As of September 17th Dyreza  now counts an additional twenty organizations directly involved in Fulfillment and Warehousing; four software companies that support Fulfillment and Warehousing; five Wholesale Computer Distributors; and its credential theft triggers include Apple, Iron Mountain, OtterBox and Badge Graphics Systems and many other well-known consumer- and business-facing technology and service brands.",

    "On September 18, 2015, we saw an activity on koreatimes.com where we captured a malicious binary. We investigated further and found that this campaign is specifically targeted to Korean sites and Korean banks.  The payload we got also specifically targets Korean banks by modifying the infected systems hosts file to redirect traffic from Korean banks to its controlled server. This means the attacker can craft a phishing website without the user knowing it is visiting a phishing site. It also targets Ahnlab by killing processes and deleting files specific to the software.

    "Early in March, while studying the ChinaZ threat, it became readily apparent that default passwords were being used for more than just a supplementary attack vector. Several bots relied heavily, if not exclusively, on systems with weak and/or default passwords to spread. We setup a system with weak and default passwords to capture any and all malware spread in this fashion. For this first test, I selected 5 sets of passwords; admin/admin, guest/guest, ubnt/ubnt, cisco/cisco and ADMIN/ADMIN (the last for picking up folks scanning for Supermicro IPMI devices). Unsurprisingly, it took just under 3 hours for the first infection to hit. What did surprise us though was what password combination was first to be hit; ubnt/ubnt.",

The Carbanak team does not just blindly compromise large numbers of computers and try to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmilk the cow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as other actors do, instead they act like a mature APT-group. They only compromise specific high-value targets and once inside the company networks, move laterally to hosts that can be monetized.",

Escelar originally surfaced in January of this year, and has since had roughly 100,000 instances of attempted infections.\nAttackers deliver the Trojan using generic Portuguese language phishing emails and are currently targeting seven Brazilian banks. Once delivered, Escelar has multiple installation stages where malware is downloaded using direct connections to multiple Microsoft SQL servers. These SQL servers are also used for command and control (C2) functionality.\nThe most recently discovered Microsoft SQL server being used as Escalar infrastructure contained records of 1660 infections that all connected in a two-day time frame.\nThe malware is able to control banking transactions conducted using Internet Explorer, and harvest email credentials, which are in turn used to spread the malware further.",

    "Google's security team recently identified a new domain masquerading as an official EFF site as part of a targeted malware campaign. That domain, electronicfrontierfoundation.org, is designed to trick users into a false sense of trust and it appears to have been used in a spear phishing attack, though it is unclear who the intended targets were. The domain was registered on August 4, 2015, under a presumably false name, and we suspect that the attack started on the same day. At the time of this writing the domain is still serving malware.\n\nElectronicfrontierfoundation.org was not the only domain involved in this attack. It seems to be part of a larger campaign, known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pawn Storm\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The current phase of the Pawn Storm attack campaign started a little over a month ago, and the overall campaign was first identified in an October 2014 report from Trend Micro (PDF).

While we monitor phishing campaigns used to distribute threats such as Dridex, Upatre, and Cryptowall, targeted phishing attacks are more convincing because the format of the message is personalized to the targeted user. This targeted attack was more difficult to detect because adversaries chose to leverage AutoIT, a well known freeware administration tool for automating system management in corporate environments. This notable characteristic made this attack worthy of further analysis. Utilizing AutoIT within a payload is unique because it is a legitimate management tool. In this attack, AutoIT was utilized to install a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and maintain persistence on the host in a manner that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s similar to normal administration activity.",

This RAT, referred to as uWarrior because of embedded PDB strings, has been previously described by an independent researcher who noted a potentially unknown exploit being used against Microsoft Office.\nInitial research into the exploit by Unit 42 indicates that this actor has opted to include multiple exploits. One is CVE-2012-1856, reinvigorated with a novel ROP chain to bypass ASLR and deliver the uWarrior payload. The other appears to be CVE-2015-1770. The malware itself is a fully featured RAT, which uses a compressed, (optionally) encrypted, raw TCP socket and binary message protocol for command and control communications.\nDuring the course of our research, it became evident that this actor had not built uWarrior from scratch, but rather opted to borrow components from several off-the-shelf tools.

The person or persons behind the attempted monitoring appear to have run other surveillance operations involving various locations throughout South America, at least one apparently targeting a rabble-rousing Argentine journalist. In the process, they created at least four distinct spyware bundles, all communicating with the same server set to receive Nisman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data.

    "Recent weeks have seen the outing of two new additions to the Duke group's toolset, SeaDuke and CloudDuke. Of these, SeaDuke is a simple trojan made interesting by the fact that it's written in Python. And even more curiously, SeaDuke, with its built-in support for both Windows and Linux, is the first cross-platform malware we have observed from the Duke group. While SeaDuke is a single - albeit cross-platform - trojan, CloudDuke appears to be an entire toolset of malware components, or \"solutions\" as the Duke group apparently calls them. These components include a unique loader, downloader, and not one but two different trojan components. CloudDuke also greatly expands on the Duke group's usage of cloud storage services, specifically Microsoft's OneDrive, as a channel for both command and control as well as the exfiltration of stolen data. Finally, some of the recent CloudDuke spear-phishing campaigns have born a striking resemblance to CozyDuke spear-phishing campaigns from a year ago.",

    "The summer months dawn on us and the financial year comes to a close. It is in the run up to this time that most organisations see an increase in targeted attack activity. \n\nWe begin by reading news of an attack against the Taiwanese Government. Whilst we would prefer to disassociate ourselves with APT attacks against Governments our interest was piqued by a particular blog written by our friends over at TrendMicro[1]. There were several things that struck us as both interesting and concerning about the details; a threat actor known to operate in South East Asia is now using secure sockets layer (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153SSL\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) encryption in their malware. SSL is typically used to encrypt data between the client and the server, thus making the content unreadable by any systems sitting between the two end points, and significantly raising the cost of defence. Without the use of SSL interception traditional IDS/IPS systems could cease to detect compromised systems.",

The Stegoloader malware family (also known as Win32/Gatak.DR and TSPY_GATAK.GTK despite not sharing any similarities with the Gataka banking trojan) was first identified at the end of 2013 and has attracted little public attention. Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers have analyzed multiple variants of this malware, which stealthily steals information from compromised systems. Stegoloader's modular design allows its operator to deploy modules as necessary, limiting the exposure of the malware capabilities during investigations and reverse engineering analysis.

The identification of cyber crime actors, particularly Nigerian 419 scam operators, attempting to exploit CVE-2014-4114 demonstrates how quickly cyber criminals are trying to exploit a vulnerability previously associated with espionage actors, using similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) to maximize their chances of success, with additional innovation as seen with these samples.",

    "During a recent United States Secret Service investigation, Trustwave encountered a new family of POS malware, that we named Punkey. It appears to have evolved from the NewPOSthings family of malware first discovered by Dennis Schwarz and Dave Loftus at Arbor Networks. While this malware shares some commonalities with that family, it departs from the standard operating procedure of the previous versions rather dramatically. In a blog post, TrendMicro also detailed recently compiled versions of the NewPOSthings family that bear a closer resemblance to NewPOSthings than Punkey. This suggests that multiple actors may be using similar source code, or the malware is being customized as a service for targeted campaigns. Because of the active investigation, I cannot reveal C&C domains used in the samples.",
