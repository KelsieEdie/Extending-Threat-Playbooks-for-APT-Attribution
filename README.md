# Activity-Attack Graphs for Intelligence-Informed Threat COA Development
## Purpose
This github repository contains code used to perform research in the field of cyber threat COA development. The paper can be found at [INSERT LINK LOL].
## Abstract
A threat course of action (COA) describes the likely
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) an adversary may
deploy across the cyber kill-chain. Threat COA development
and analysis informs hunt teams, incident responders, and threat
emulation efforts on likely activities the adversary will conduct
during an attack. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
to generate and evaluate threat COAs through association rule
mining. We identify frequent TTP itemsets to create a set of activ-
ity groups that describe associations between TTPs. We overlay
activity groups to create a directed and edge-weighted activity-
attack graph. The graphs hypothesize various adversary avenues
of attack, and the weighted edges inform the analystâ€™s trust of a
hypothesized TTP in the COA. Our research identifies meaningful
associations between TTPs and provides an analytical approach
to generating threat COAs. Further, our implementation uses the
STIX framework for extensibility and usability in a variety of
threat intelligence environments.
